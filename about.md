I'm a Java developer that has created a few open source libraries including JFreeChart, [Orson Charts](http://www.object-refinery.com/orsoncharts/index.html), JFreeSVG, [OrsonPDF](http://www.object-refinery.com/orsonpdf/index.html) and [FXGraphics2D](https://github.com/jfree/fxgraphics2d).  I was born in New Zealand, and currently live in Switzerland.
