title: 3D Charts for Java
---

In the last week I continued my efforts to streamline my open source libraries, and released a new version of [Orson Charts](https://github.com/jfree/orson-charts) (a 3D chart library for the Java platform).  I moved the JavaFX support into a separate project [Orson Charts FX](https://github.com/jfree/orson-charts-fx), transferred the demo code into separate projects and removed Ant build support (leaving just the Maven-based builds).

Here is a screenshot from the JavaFX demo application (which you can find in the [JFree FX Demos](https://github.com/jfree/jfree-fxdemos) project):

Also included in the release are a few bug fixes:

####Version 1.7 : 17-Nov-2017

* removed JavaFX support to a separate project Orson Charts FX;
* fixed cell content bug in `GridElement`;
* fixed bug in `GradientColorScale`;
* protect from `NullPointerException` in `AbstractValueAxis3D`;
* streamline build by removing Ant build support and moving demo code to external projects.
