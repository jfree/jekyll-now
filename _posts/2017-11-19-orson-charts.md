title: 3D Charts for Java
---

In the last week I continued my efforts to streamline my open source libraries, and released a new version of [Orson Charts](https://github.com/jfree/orson-charts) (a 3D chart library for the Java platform).  I moved the JavaFX support into a separate project [Orson Charts FX](https://github.com/jfree/orson-charts), transferred the demo code into separate projects and removed Ant build support (leaving just the Maven-based builds).

Here is a screenshot from the JavaFX demo application (which you can find in the [JFree FXDemos](https://github.com/jfree/jfree-fxdemos) project):
