Alongside JFreeChart and JFreeChart-FX, I have created a suite of demonstration applications to illustrate how to create various types of charts.  

![jfreechart-demo-1.5.0-screenshot.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/screenshots/jfreechart-demo-1.5.0-screenshot.png "JFreeChart Demo Application")

To run these, you can download the following jar files:

* [JFreeChart Demos](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jfree-demos/jfreechart-demo-1.5.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar)
* [JFreeChart-FX Demos](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jfree-demos/jfreechart-fx-demo-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar)

You can run the JFreeChart Demos using:

`java -jar jfreechart-demo-1.5.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

...and the JFreeChart FX Demos using:

`java -jar jfreechart-fx-demo-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

The source code for these demos is made available when you [support the JFreeChart Project](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/devguide.html).
